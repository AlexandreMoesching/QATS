Description: In hidden Markov models, one observes a noisy version of an 
    unobservable finite-state Markov chain. One of the main components of hidden 
    Markov models is to decode that signal, that is to estimate the sequence of 
    hidden states at the origin of the observation sequence. Existing decoding 
    algorithms such as Viterbi (1967) algorithm have computational complexity at 
    best linear in the size of the observed sequence, and sub-quadratic in the 
    size of the state space. Assuming that the observation sequence is stored as 
    specific cumulative sums, we present Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation 
    (QATS), a procedure which decodes the hidden sequence in polylogarithmic 
    computational complexity in the size of the sequence, and cubic in the size 
    of the state space. In essence, the estimated sequence of states 
    sequentially maximizes local likelihood scores among all local paths with at 
    most three segments. The latter search is performed only approximately using 
    an adaptive search procedure. The resulting sequence is admissible in the 
    sense that all transitions occur with positive probability.
